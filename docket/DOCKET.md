# AGENTIC-TOOLKIT DOCKET

**Open items only.** Closed items move to `archive/<year>.md` with their
verification records. The id space is shared across open and archive and ids
are never reused — a "#N" in a commit subject refers to these numbers (this
docket is the tracker). When an item ships: stamp it ✅ with the date and
verification status, then move the entry to the archive in the same action.
Stale open markers cost real sessions — closing means moving.

### 31. sync.sh reports "0 failed" when rsync actually fails (2026-08-15)

Found 2026-08-15 building git-worktree (#26).

A brand-new standalone plugin has no `dist/plugins/<name>/skills/<name>/`
directory yet. rsync cannot create nested parents, so the skill-tree copy fails:

```
rsync: [Receiver] mkdir ".../dist/plugins/git-worktree/skills/git-worktree"
  failed: No such file or directory (2)
rsync error: error in file IO (code 11)
```

**`sync.sh` printed `done — 36 synced, 0 skipped, 0 failed` on that same run.**
The rsync exit status is not checked, so a genuine copy failure is reported as a
success. It was only caught because `node --test` failed afterwards
(`dist-mirror` + `agent-plugins`), which is the safety net working — but the
sync output actively lied first, and a session that trusted it would have
committed a plugin with no skills.

Two things to decide:

1. **Check the rsync exit status** and count it as a failure. That is the actual
   bug — the `failed` counter exists and is never incremented from this path.
2. **Create the dest dir before rsync** (`mkdir -p`), which removes the failure
   mode for new plugins entirely. `toolkit-foundry`'s scaffold step tells the
   author to `mkdir -p dist/plugins/<name>/skills/<name>/references` by hand;
   sync doing it itself makes that step unnecessary rather than load-bearing.

Both are small. (1) is the correctness fix and should land regardless; (2) is
the ergonomic one. Note the interaction: with (2) alone the symptom disappears
but the silent-failure class stays for every other rsync invocation.

### 7. Spec MCP server — revisit when specs gain write-side invariants (2026-08-05)

Declined for now (2026-08-05): specs are read-mostly markdown — router lookup is ls + fuzzy match, agents read files natively, and a server would duplicate the file path every skill must keep anyway. Reconsider docket-style (thin MCP over a CLI) only if specs grow mutations worth guarding: enforced changelog stamps on drift decisions, cross-spec link integrity, or a host-enforced spec-before-plan gate.

### 10. Reopen A4 collision detection — the falsification was lexical-only (2026-08-09)

A4 (collision automation) is recorded as CLOSED in
`skills/toolkit-research-frontier/references/health-campaign.md`: the
preregistered criterion was "static n-gram overlap reproduces >=80% of observed
collisions with <20% false alarms", and `scripts/collision-scan.mjs --check`
returned **max 5% recall at every threshold 0.08-0.18**.

The verified reason for that result is method-specific, and reads as a general
closure today: our collisions are *semantic* adjacencies whose contracts share
almost no vocabulary, because the 2026-07-08 disambiguation passes had already
de-overlapped them lexically. That falsifies n-grams. It says nothing about a
semantic detector.

Upstream precedent: `github/awesome-copilot`, `.github/workflows/duplicate-resource-detector.md`
(MIT) — a weekly scheduled agentic workflow with three ideas we never tried:

| idea | what it does |
|---|---|
| semantic compare | name + description + first ~20 body lines, judged by meaning, with worked negatives in the prompt (two same-style code-review resources = duplicates; general-React vs React-testing = not) |
| durable accept-list | searches *closed* issues labelled `duplicate-review` for "intentionally separate" / "keep both" / checked boxes, excludes those pairs, annotates re-flags with "(previously reviewed — see #N)" |
| containment | `safe-outputs: create-issue: {max: 1, close-older-issues: true}` + `noop` when clean — the agent can never hold more than one open issue |

Why it fits here specifically: A3's dominant error mode is one-hop adjacency
pairs (discovery<->session-handoff on "resume", draft-plan<->technical-spec on
doc-creation) — exactly the signal a semantic detector reads and a lexical one
cannot. And we already own the accept-list ingredient: the curated
empirical-pair registry inside `scripts/collision-scan.mjs`, currently updated
by hand per eval round.

Decide before building: whether the accept-list lives in GitHub issues (their
model, needs the workflow to have issue read access) or stays in the repo as
the existing registry (our model, no egress, but needs a review ritual).

Whatever the outcome, this needs an A4 addendum in `health-campaign.md`
recording that the falsification was method-specific — the entry currently
reads as though collision automation is a dead end in general.

### 14. Price a trajectory-based routing eval against the judge-prompt harness (2026-08-09)

`scripts/eval-triggers.mjs` renders the live skill catalog into a prompt and
asks a judge model which skill it would route each query to. That is deliberate
— the header says it presents "the catalog the host sees" — and it produced ten
dated reports and a defensible ~89-92% operating band. Its known cost is written
into A3: **judge variance is the dominant error mode** (44 flaky cases, mostly
one-hop adjacencies).

A different measurement exists. `@microsoft/vally` (MIT, 0.13.0) ships
`dist/graders/static/skill-invocation-grader.js`: it takes
`{required: string[], disallowed: string[]}`, walks `trajectory.events`, counts
`event.type === "skill_activation"`, and passes only when every required skill
activated and no disallowed one did. Grader metadata is `costProfile: "free"`,
`determinism: "static"` — the grading is free and deterministic. The cost sits
entirely in producing the trajectory: one real agent run per stimulus, against
~394 cases.

What it would buy: no judge variance, and it measures the host's actual
skill-loading behaviour rather than a model's opinion about a rendered catalog.

The primitive worth stealing regardless of the verdict: **`disallowed`** — a
first-class "this skill must NOT fire here" assertion. Our `should_trigger:
false` cases approximate it as a routing decision, not as an observed
non-activation, which is a weaker claim about exactly the collisions we care
about most.

This is a pricing exercise, not a rewrite. Concretely: run a ~30-case subset
both ways, compare per-case agreement, and cost the full run in wall-clock and
tokens. If the two agree closely, the cheap harness is vindicated and this
closes; if they diverge on the flaky adjacency seams, that is a real finding
about A3's numbers.

Also in vally if this ever gets built out: `compare` (pairwise comparison of two
eval runs — what we do by hand across dated reports), `max-repeat` and
`loop-outcome` graders, JSONL/JUnit/markdown reporters.
